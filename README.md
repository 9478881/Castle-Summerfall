# The-CS-Project
This game is a text-adventure-inspired roguelike video game. The gameplay takes place in a terminal, where the player enters commands to perform actions and is then given descriptions of what occurs. They will advance through a virtual dungeon, collecting equipment and defeating enemies that they come across in order to advance deeper into the dungeon. The goal is to survive and explore as far as possible, climbing down through multiple procedurally generated floors which will become progressively more difficult. The combat will be turn-based, with the player taking a turn to attack and then being attacked by any enemies that may be within range
